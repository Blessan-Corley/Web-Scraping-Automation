## ⚙️ Configuration

### config.json Settings:

```json
{
  "portal": {
    "base_url": "https://portal.kitcbe.com/index.php/Login",
    "password": "kit@123"
  },
  "departments": {
    "aids": {
      "prefix": "711524BAD",
      "start": 1,
      "end": 180
    }
  }
}
```

### To Process Different Department:

Edit last line in `automation.py`:
```python
automation.run("cse")  # Change "aids" to "cse", "ece", etc.
```

---

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### 1. Test First (ALWAYS!)
```bash
python test_single.py
```

### 2. Process One Department
```bash
# Edit automation.py last line to:
automation.run("aids")

# Then run:
python automation.py
```

### 3. Process Multiple Departments
Edit `automation.py` main block:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    automation = KITPortalAutomation("config.json")
    
    for dept in ["aids", "cse", "ece"]:
        print(f"\n\nProcessing {dept.upper()}...")
        automation.run(dept)
        time.sleep(5)  # Pause between departments
```

### 4. Process Specific Roll Numbers
Create custom list:
```python
# In automation.py, replace generate_roll_numbers():
roll_numbers = [
    "711524BAD001",
    "711524BAD005",
    "711524BAD010"
]
```

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

- **Single student**: ~8-10 seconds
- **10 students**: ~2 minutes
- **50 students**: ~8-10 minutes
- **180 students**: ~25-30 minutes

*Timing includes CAPTCHA solving, navigation delays, and data extraction*

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Login Failed" for all students

**Solution 1: Check CAPTCHA**
```bash
# Run test to see CAPTCHA quality:
python test_captcha_only.py
```

**Solution 2: Verify Credentials**
- Roll number: `711524BAD001` (capital BAD)
- Password: `kit@123`

**Solution 3: Check Portal Access**
- Open browser manually
- Try logging in with same credentials
- Ensure portal is accessible

### Issue: "Profile Navigation Failed"

**Solution:**
The profile selector might have changed. Check screenshot and update line in `automation.py`:
```python
# Line ~350, try different selector:
profile_elem = self.driver.find_element(By.XPATH, 
    "//img[@alt='profile']"  # Adjust based on your page
)
```

### Issue: Photos Not Downloading

**Solution:**
Check photo URL pattern:
```python
# Add debug logging in extract_profile_data():
logger.info(f"Photo URL: {photo_url}")
```

Then adjust URL construction if needed.

### Issue: Excel File Too Large

**Solution:**
Reduce photo quality:
```python
# In save_to_excel(), change:
img.thumbnail((50, 50))  # Instead of (100, 100)
```

Or skip photos entirely:
```python
# Comment out photo embedding section
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

After running, you'll see:
```
AUTOMATION COMPLETED
Total: 180 | Success: 175 | Failed: 5
```

**Success rate > 95%** is excellent!

**Failed students** usually due to:
- CAPTCHA misread (rare with good OCR)
- Network timeout
- Missing data on portal

Check `automation.log` for failed student details.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Rate Limiting
- Script includes 2-second delays
- Don't reduce delays below 1 second
- Portal may block if too aggressive

### 2. CAPTCHA Accuracy
- OCR accuracy: ~80-90% with simple CAPTCHA
- Failed logins will retry automatically
- Check `captcha_temp.png` if issues persist

### 3. Data Privacy
- Output files contain sensitive student data
- Keep files secure
- Don't share publicly
- Delete after use if no longer needed

### 4. Portal Changes
- Portal structure may change
- Selectors may need updates
- Check screenshots and update XPath
- Use `find_selectors.py` to debug

---

## 🎓 Advanced Tips

### 1. Headless Mode (No Browser Window)
```python
# In setup_driver(), uncomment:
options.add_argument('--headless')
```

### 2. Parallel Processing (Advanced)
⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - May trigger anti-bot measures

### 3. Resume Failed Students
```python
# After first run, check Excel for failed students
# Create list of failed roll numbers
failed = ["711524BAD005", "711524BAD015"]

# Process only failed students
for roll in failed:
    automation.process_student(roll)
```

### 4. Export to CSV
```python
# Add to save_to_excel():
df.to_csv(output_path.replace('.xlsx', '.csv'), index=False)
```
